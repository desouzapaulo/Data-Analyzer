To correct accelerometer readings when the sensor is offset from the center of gravity, you can use the following formula³:

$$a_C = a_A + \omega \times (\omega \times c) + \alpha \times c$$

where:
- $a_C$ is the acceleration at the center of gravity,
- $a_A$ is the acceleration measured by the accelerometer,
- $\omega$ is the angular velocity,
- $c$ is the vector from the accelerometer to the center of gravity, and
- $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.

This formula accounts for the fact that the accelerometer will read an acceleration whenever the vehicle rotates, even though the center of mass is not accelerating¹. The terms $\omega \times (\omega \times c)$ and $\alpha \times c$ correct for this effect.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified model and may not account for all factors in a real-world scenario. For example, if the vehicle is a launch vehicle that loses a significant portion of its mass in a short time, the simple $F = ma$ model for center of mass motion may no longer be accurate¹.

Also, note that gyroscope readings are unaffected by placement, unless accelerations affect the readings². If this is the case, it should be noted in the datasheet of your sensor².

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have
